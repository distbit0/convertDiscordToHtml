This implies there is no liquidation at all: if the trader has the opposite token as collateral, this is necessarily more valuable than the reserves expected by the LPer (eg. ETH is more valuable if the market price is high, and USDC is more valuable if the market price is low).</td>

With minimal collateral one could transfer the legitimate asset of the pair (eg. eth) to the pool of the outside spot dex. The malicious asset cannot be turned back into eth so it could effectively drain that specific pool. Since the pools are isolated, it will not affect all the other eth in the protocol but only that specific isolated pool. So I guess it's up to the user to do their proper DD before providing liquidity. Same way one shouldn't blindlessly buy any token on uniswap</td>

Eg when the protocol tries to swap traders 100 usdc to 0.11 eth but fail due to slippage?</td>

The trader receives LP which he exchanges to ETH and then to USDC and he has to take into account the slippage.\n\nBut in case of LP redemption, as I understand it, he can redeem both in ETH and USDC and there is no need to change tokens to lose part of commission on exchange.

      <td>What is nice here is that the trader does not have to do this final swapping themselves, they just return reserves/collateral to the protocol, and the protocol does any swapping required to put liquidity back into the float pool (float pool being InfinityPools' underlying spot DEX).\nThe protocol can always do this, irrespective of slippage, because the price used for swapping is the float pool price, which is the price which determines what reserves the liquidity needs. So eg. in your first scenario, slippage can happen down to 900 (all fine up to then as there is collateral to cover it), and then it's even easier because the trader returned ETH and below a float pool price of 900, the liquidity (whose range was at 900) requires ETH as reserves, so no swapping needed.</td>

The float pool has an adaptive fee strategy to enable this. Also meaning LPers don't have to waste their time and capital in a pool with poor yield, due to the fee level being inadequate.</td>

Then replenishing after one day means getting a new loan (half the size of the initial one), so the token swapping required is actually USDC to ETH still. Keep in mind for this swap any DEX can be used, so global chain liquidity is available. Also, the collateral can actually be provided in ETH directly, rather that USDC, so no swapping needed there. Actually ETH collateral is more natural for going long, but the explanation is easier with USDC collateral (which can be used as well), which is why that case is used in the High Level Overview.</td>

The intermediate case of pool price in the middle of the range also works because as you sell ETH for USDC in the pool, its price goes down, and when pool price goes down, the LP range requires a smaller proportion of USDC, so there is a point where the USDC available (increasing) and required (decreasing) match up.</td>

Actually you can find in Fig. 4 of the whitepaper that the payoff for the trader starts off like a long put (out of the money), and becomes a long call (in the money) once the reserves are exchanged (from USDC to ETH). This is how the trader gets 10x long exposure.\nOn the other hand if you want an out-of-the-money call, you can borrow an LP range which is above the pool price (eg. at 1100 rather than 900, in the scenario of ETHUSDC price at 1000). This already comes with ETH reserves, so no need to exchange the reserves at all, you will be able to take profit at any price above 1100.</td>

Is there any issues there if the position is then closed? I guess not. The LP will be some combination of USDC and ETH.

In order to account for it, there is no need for transactions to happen continuously on chain though - whenever a transaction happens, the contract computes the flow of tokens which went in and out of the float pool since the last transactions. Bringing the state of the contract forward in time up to the current block timestamp, so to speak.\nThe reason why the collateral is sufficient to recreate liquidity remains the same. If the price goes below 900 for example, the LP expects ETH as reserves anyway, so no swap is needed, and float pool isn't used at that point.</td>
